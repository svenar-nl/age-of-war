Lets start off with the obvious, louissi. Even though there was legal trouble between him and maxgames, to me he will always be the owner of age of war. I wanted this game to be as close to the original.

I would also like to thank my friends and family for always supporting me through rough times and giving me unconditional love.

I used a lot of tutorials on YouTube to put this together. As way of thanking those creators this game is free and open source. Check it out on Github!

Finally I would like to thank you, the player. Thank you for your time and I hope this was a nice nostalgia trip for you.
